Usage
=====

As a volunteer working on poets.org, I am developing blackbox tests using RSpec and Selenium-Webdriver. Anyone is free to view or fork this repository for reference but under the honor code I ask that people refrain from running these tests against poets.org to avoid skewing product analytics.

Backlog
=======
<<<<<<< HEAD
Rather than create a backlog in github issues, I am evolving the backlog using mindmaps, images of which are attached to the [open github issues in this repo](https://github.com/carolmirakove/poets-tests/issues). I will open issues only for tasks on deck or in progress.
